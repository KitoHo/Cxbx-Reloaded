Cxbx-Reloaded
=============

A fork of Cxbx with support for running on 64-bit operating systems
I was able to get this partially working around two years previous, however, it was extremely buggy and only booted on 1/3 of my systems.
For those interested, somebody mirrored my previous attempt here: https://github.com/Darkrush3760/Cxbx-Reloaded

Why do I think it will go better this time around?
Well, I've been working on my own LLE/HLE hybrid Xbox Emulator (that is far from ready for a public release) and I believe I can use my newly gained knowledge to improve this.

Why Cxbx-Reloaded?
The plan for future development is a massive refactor of the code base, when complete, it may not resemble Cxbx much at all.
