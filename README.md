Cxbx-Reloaded
=============

My second attempt at adding adding support for 64-bit operating systems. 
I was able to get this partially working around two years previous, however, it was extremely buggy and only booted on 1/3 of my systems.
For those interested, somebody mirrored my previous attempt here: https://github.com/Darkrush3760/Cxbx-Reloaded

Why do I think it will go better this time around?
Well, I've been working on my own LLE/HLE hybrid Xbox Emulator (that is far from ready for a public release) and I believe I can use my newly gained knowledge to improve this.
